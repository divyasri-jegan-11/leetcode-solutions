**Customer Table:**

| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 0          | Y        | N          |
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |
| 4          | N        | N          |

## 📤 Output

| product_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 3          |

---

## ✅ Explanation

Only products with both `low_fats = 'Y'` and `recyclable = 'Y'` are selected.  
So, only **product_id 1 and 3** meet both conditions.

## 💡 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT name FROM Customer 
  WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2;
