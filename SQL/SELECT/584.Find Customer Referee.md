**Customer Table:**

| id | name | referee_id |
|----|------|------------|
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |

---

## 📤 Output

| product_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 3          |

---

## ✅ Explanation

Only products with both `low_fats = 'Y'` and `recyclable = 'Y'` are selected.  
So, only **product_id 1 and 3** meet both conditions.

## 💡 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT name FROM Customer 
  WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2;
