# 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products

## üìù Problem Statement

### Table: `Products`

| Column Name | Type         |
|-------------|--------------|
| product_id  | int          |
| low_fats    | enum('Y','N')|
| recyclable  | enum('Y','N')|

- `product_id` is the primary key.
- `low_fats` column indicates if the product is low fat ('Y' or 'N').
- `recyclable` column indicates if the product is recyclable ('Y' or 'N').

  Write an SQL query to find the IDs of products that are both **low fat** and **recyclable**.

## üì• Example Input

**Products Table:**

| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 0          | Y        | N          |
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |
| 4          | N        | N          |

## üì§ Output

| product_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 3          |

Explanation:
 - Only products with both `low_fats = 'Y'` and `recyclable = 'Y'` are selected.  
 - So, only **product_id 1 and 3** meet both conditions.

## üí° SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
