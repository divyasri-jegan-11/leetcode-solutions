# 1978. Employees Whose Manager Left the Company

## üìù Problem Statement

###  Table : `Employees`


| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |

 - In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
 - This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
 

Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than `$30000` and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the `Employees` table, but the reports still have their `manager_id` set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

### Example Input:

Input: 
Employees table:

| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |

Output: 

| employee_id |
|-------------|
| 11          |


Explanation: 
 - The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).
 - Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).
 - Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.
## üí° SQL Solution

```sql


SELECT e.employee_id FROM Employees AS e 
LEFT JOIN Employees AS Manager 
ON (e.manager_id = Manager.employee_id)
WHERE e.salary< 30000
 AND e.manager_id IS NOT NULL
 AND Manager.employee_id IS NULL
 ORDER BY 1;

WITH InsuranceCount AS (
    SELECT tiv_2016,
    COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY tiv_2015) AS tiv_count,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY lat,lon ) AS city_count
    FROM Insurance
)
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016),2) AS tiv_2016
FROM InsuranceCount 
WHERE tiv_count>1
AND city_count=1;
