# 1321. Restaurant Growth

## 📝 Problem Statement

### Table: `Customer`


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |

 - In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
 - This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
 

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

Return the result table ordered by visited_on in `ascending order.`

### Example Input:

Input: 
Triangle table:

| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |

Output: 

| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |


   
## 💡 SQL Solution

```sql

SELECT *,
     IF (x+y>z AND x+z>y AND y+z>x, 'Yes','No') AS triangle
     FROM Triangle;

WITH
  Dates AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT visited_on
    FROM Customer
    WHERE visited_on >= (
      SELECT DATE_ADD(MIN(visited_on), INTERVAL 6 DAY)
      FROM Customer
    )
  )
SELECT
  Dates.visited_on,
  SUM(Customer.amount) AS amount,
  ROUND(SUM(Customer.amount) / 7, 2) AS average_amount
FROM Dates
LEFT JOIN Customer
  ON (DATEDIFF(Dates.visited_on, Customer.visited_on) BETWEEN 0 AND 6)
GROUP BY 1;
