# 626. Exchange Seats

## üìù Problem Statement

###  Table :  `Seat`


| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |

 - id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
 - Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
 - The ID sequence always starts from 1 and increments continuously.
 

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by `id` in ascending order.

### Example Input:

Input: 
RequestAccepted table:

| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |

Output: 

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 3  | 3   |

Explanation: 
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.

## üí° SQL Solution

```sql


WITH AllIds AS (
    SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT accepter_id FROM RequestAccepted
)
SELECT id,
       COUNT(*) as num
       FROM AllIds
       GROUP BY 1
       ORDER BY 2 DESC
       LIMIT 1;


SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY IF(MOD(id,2) =0,id-1,id+1)) AS id,
student FROM Seat;
