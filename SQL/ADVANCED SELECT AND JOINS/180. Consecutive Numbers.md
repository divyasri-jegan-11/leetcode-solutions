# 180. Consecutive Numbers

## üìù Problem Statement

### Table: `Logs`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |

 - In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
 - id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.
 

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.
 

### Example Input:

Input: 
Logs table:

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |

Output: 

| ConsecutiveNums |
|-----------------|
| 1               |

Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
## üí° SQL Solution

```sql

SELECT employee_id, department_id FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
UNION DISTINCT
SELECT employee_id, department_id FROM Employee
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;

WITH LogsNeighbors AS (
    SELECT *,
          LAG(num) OVER(ORDER BY id ) AS prev_num,
          LEAD(num) OVER(ORDER BY id) AS next_num
    FROM Logs
 )
 SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
 FROM LogsNeighbors
 WHERE num = prev_num AND num = next_num;
