|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |

 - Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.

### Example Input:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:

| num |
|-----|
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |

Output: 

| num |
|-----|
| 6   |

Explanation: 
 - The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
 - Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.


## üí° SQL Solution

```sql

WITH UniqueNumbers AS(
    SELECT num FROM MyNumbers GROUP BY 1 HAVING COUNT(num) = 1
)
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM UniqueNumbers;

SELECT p.product_id,
       COALESCE((
       SELECT new_price 
       FROM Products 
       WHERE product_id = p.product_id AND change_date <= '2019-08-16'
       ORDER BY change_date DESC
       LIMIT 1),
       10) AS price
       FROM (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM Products) AS p;
