# 1667. Fix Names in a Table

## üìù Problem Statement

###  Table :  `Users`


| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| user_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |

 - user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
 - This table contains the ID and the name of the user. The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.
 

Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

### Example Input:

Input: 
Seat table:

| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |

Output: 

| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |

Explanation: 
 - Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

   
## üí° SQL Solution

```sql


SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY IF(MOD(id,2) =0,id-1,id+1)) AS id,
student FROM Seat;

SELECT user_id,
       CONCAT(
        UPPER(SUBSTRING(name,1,1)),
        LOWER(SUBSTRING(name,2))
        )AS name
     FROM Users 
     ORDER BY 1;
