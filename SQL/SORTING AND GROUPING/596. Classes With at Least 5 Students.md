## 📝 Problem Statement

### Table: `Courses`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| student     | varchar |
| class       | varchar |

 - (student, class) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
 - Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.
 

Write a solution to find all the classes that have at least five students.

Return the result table in any order.

### Example Input:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:

| num |
|-----|
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |

Output: 

| num |
|-----|
| 6   |

Explanation: 
 - The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
 - Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.


## 💡 SQL Solution

```sql

WITH UniqueNumbers AS(
    SELECT num FROM MyNumbers GROUP BY 1 HAVING COUNT(num) = 1
)
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM UniqueNumbers;

SELECT class FROM Courses 
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) >=5;
