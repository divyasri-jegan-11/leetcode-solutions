 # Example Input:
Input: 
Cinema table:

| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |

Output: 

| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |

Explanation: 
 - We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.


## üí° SQL Solution

```sql



SELECT * FROM Cinema 
WHERE id % 2 = 1
AND description !='boring' 
 ORDER BY rating DESC;

SELECT s.product_id, s.year AS first_year, s.quantity,s.price 
FROM Sales s 
JOIN (
     SELECT product_id,MIN(year) AS first_year
     FROM Sales
     GROUP BY product_id
      ) AS first_sales
 ON s.product_id = first_sales.product_id AND  s.year= first_year ;
