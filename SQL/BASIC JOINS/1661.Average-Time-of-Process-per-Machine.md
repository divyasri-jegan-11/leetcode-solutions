# 1661. Average Time of Process per Machine

## üìù Problem Statement
There is a factory website that has several machines each running the * same number of processes *. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.


Return the result table sorted in `any order.`


### Table: `Visits`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| visit_id    | int     |
| customer_id | int     |

 - visit_id is the column with unique values for this table.
 - This table contains information about the customers who visited the mall.
 

### Table: `Transactions`

| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| transaction_id | int     |
| visit_id       | int     |
| amount         | int     |

 - transaction_id is column with unique values for this table.
 - This table contains information about the transactions made during the visit_id.

## üì• Example Input
Input: 
Visits

| visit_id | customer_id |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |
| 5        | 54          |
| 6        | 96          |
| 7        | 54          |
| 8        | 54          |

Transactions

| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |
| 12             | 1        | 910    |
| 13             | 2        | 970    |

Output: 

| customer_id | count_no_trans |
|-------------|----------------|
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |

Explanation: 
 - Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
 - Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
 - Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
 - Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
 - Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.

As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

## üí° SQL Solution

```sql

SELECT s.student_id , s.student_name, sub.subject_name ,
    COUNT(e.student_id) AS attended_exams
    FROM Students s 
    CROSS JOIN Subjects sub 
    LEFT JOIN Examinations e
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
    GROUP BY s.student_id ,s.student_name,sub.subject_name
    ORDER BY s.student_id ,sub.subject_name;



SELECT machine_id, 
       ROUND(AVG(end_time - start_time), 3) AS processing_time
FROM (
    SELECT machine_id, process_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END) AS end_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END) AS start_time
