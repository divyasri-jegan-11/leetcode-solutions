# 1934. Confirmation Rate

## üìù Problem Statement
The **confirmation rate** of a user is the number of `'confirmed'` messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is `0`. Round the confirmation rate to **two decimal** places.

Write a solution to find the **confirmation rate** of each user.

Return the result table sorted in **any order.**


### Table: `Activity`

| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |

 - The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
  - machine_id is the ID of a machine.
  - process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
  - activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
  - timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
  'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
  - The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
 - It is guaranteed that each (machine_id, process_id) pair has a 'start' and 'end' timestamp.

## üì• Example Input
Input : Activity 

| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
|------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |

Output: 

| machine_id | processing_time |
|-----------|------------------|
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |

Explanation: 
 - There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.
 - Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894
 - Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995
 - Machine 2's average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = 1.456

## üí° SQL Solution

```sql

SELECT machine_id, 
       ROUND(AVG(end_time - start_time), 3) AS processing_time
FROM (
    SELECT machine_id, process_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END) AS end_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END) AS start_time
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY machine_id, process_id
) AS process_times
GROUP BY machine_id;


SELECT s.user_id,ROUND(IFNULL(SUM(c.action = 'confirmed')/ COUNT(c.user_id),0),2)
AS confirmation_rate
  FROM Signups s
  LEFT JOIN Confirmations c
  ON s.user_id = c.user_id
  GROUP BY s.user_id
  ORDER BY s.user_id;
