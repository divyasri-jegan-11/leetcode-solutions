SELECT s.student_id , s.student_name, sub.subject_name ,
    COUNT(e.student_id) AS attended_exams
    FROM Students s 
    CROSS JOIN Subjects sub 
    LEFT JOIN Examinations e
    ON s.student_id = e.student_id AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
    GROUP BY s.student_id ,s.student_name,sub.subject_name
    ORDER BY s.student_id ,sub.subject_name;

SELECT v.customer_id ,COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL
