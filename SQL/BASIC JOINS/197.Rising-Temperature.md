## 💡 SQL Solution

```sql


SELECT s.user_id,ROUND(IFNULL(SUM(c.action = 'confirmed')/ COUNT(c.user_id),0),2)
AS confirmation_rate
  FROM Signups s
  LEFT JOIN Confirmations c
  ON s.user_id = c.user_id
  GROUP BY s.user_id
  ORDER BY s.user_id;

SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1 ,Weather w2 
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature
AND DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) =1;
