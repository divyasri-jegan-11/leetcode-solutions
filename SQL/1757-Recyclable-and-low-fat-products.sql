### ðŸ“¦ SQL Query: Select Recyclable and Low-Fat Products

#### ðŸ§¾ Problem Statement
You are given a table `Products` with the following schema:

| Column Name   | Type                  |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| product_id    | int                   |
| product_name  | varchar               |
| category      | varchar               |
| recyclable    | enum ('Yes', 'No')    |
| low_fats      | enum ('Yes', 'No')    |

Write an SQL query to find the **IDs and names of all products that are both recyclable ('Yes') and low-fat ('Yes')**.

Return the result table in any order.

#### ðŸ’¡ Solution

```sql
SELECT product_id, product_name
FROM Products
WHERE recyclable = 'Yes' AND low_fats = 'Yes';
```

---

#### ðŸ§  Explanation
- We use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve:
  - `product_id`
  - `product_name`
- The `WHERE` clause filters the records by two conditions:
  - `recyclable = 'Yes'`
  - `low_fats = 'Yes'`
- Only rows that meet **both** conditions will be included in the final result.
