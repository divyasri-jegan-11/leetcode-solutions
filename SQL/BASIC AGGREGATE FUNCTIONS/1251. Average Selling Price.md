# 1251. Average Selling Price

## üìù Problem Statement

### Table: `Prices`


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | int     |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |

 - (product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
 - Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
 - For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
 

### Table: `UnitsSold`

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |

 - This table may contain duplicate rows.
 - Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
 
Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. `average_price `should be rounded to 2 decimal places. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.

Return the result table in **any order**.

## üì• Example Input

Input : Queries 

| query_name | result            | position | rating |
|------------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |

Output: 

| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
|------------|---------|-----------------------|
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |


Explanation: 
 - Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
 - Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

 - Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
 - Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

## üí° SQL Solution

```sql

SELECT query_name ,
       ROUND(AVG(rating / position),2) AS quality,
       ROUND(AVG(rating <3)* 100,2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries
GROUP BY 1;
SELECT  p.product_id ,
        IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(u.units * p.price) /SUM(u.units),2),0) AS average_price
FROM  Prices p LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
ON p.product_id = u.product_id
AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;
