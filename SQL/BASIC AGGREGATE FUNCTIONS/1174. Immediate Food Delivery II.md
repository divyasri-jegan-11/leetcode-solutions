# 1174. Immediate Food Delivery II

## üìù Problem Statement

### Table: `Delivery`

| Column Name                 | Type    |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |

 - delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
 - The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 
If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called **immediate**; otherwise, it is called **scheduled**.

The **first order** of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.
 

### Table: `Employee`

| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |

 - employee_id is the primary key of this table. It's guaranteed that experience_years is not NULL.
 - Each row of this table contains information about one employee.

## üì• Example Input

Input:  Project table:

| project_id  | employee_id |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |

Employee table:

| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |

Output: 

| project_id  | average_years |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |

 Explanation: 
  - The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50

## üí° SQL Solution

```sql


SELECT p.project_id ,ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years),2) AS average_years  FROM Project p 
JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;

WITH CustomerToIsImmediate AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT customer_id,
    FIRST_VALUE (order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date) is_immediate
        FROM Delivery
    )
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(is_immediate)*100,2)  immediate_percentage
    FROM CustomerToIsImmediate;
