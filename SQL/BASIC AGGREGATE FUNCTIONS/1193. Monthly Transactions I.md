 - The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
 - The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
 - Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.

## üí° SQL Solution

```sql

WITH CustomerToIsImmediate AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT customer_id,
    FIRST_VALUE (order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date) is_immediate
        FROM Delivery
    )
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(is_immediate)*100,2)  immediate_percentage
    FROM CustomerToIsImmediate;

SELECT DATE_FORMAT (trans_date ,'%Y-%m') AS month, country,
       COUNT(*) AS trans_count,
       SUM(state='approved') AS approved_count,
       SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
       SUM(IF(state ='approved',amount,0)) AS approved_total_amount
       FROM Transactions 
       GROUP BY 1,2;
