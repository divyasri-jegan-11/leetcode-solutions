# 620. Not Boring Movies

## üìù Problem Statement

### Table: `Cinema`


| Column Name    | Type     |
|----------------|----------|
| id             | int      |
| movie          | varchar  |
| description    | varchar  |
| rating         | float    |

 - id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
 - Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
 
Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not `"boring"`.

Return the result table ordered by `rating` in descending order.

 # Example Input:
Input: 
Cinema table:

| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |

Output: 

| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |

Explanation: 
 - We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.


## üí° SQL Solution

```sql


WITH
  Players AS (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY 1
  )
SELECT ROUND(
    COUNT(Players.player_id) / (
      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Activity.player_id)
      FROM Activity
    ),
    2
  ) AS fraction
FROM Players
INNER JOIN Activity
  ON (
    Players.player_id = Activity.player_id
    AND DATEDIFF(Players.first_login, Activity.event_date) = -1)

SELECT * FROM Cinema 
WHERE id % 2 = 1
AND description !='boring' 
 ORDER BY rating DESC;
