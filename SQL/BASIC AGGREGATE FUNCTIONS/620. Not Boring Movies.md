| movie          | varchar  |
| description    | varchar  |
| rating         | float    |

 - id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
 - Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
 
Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not `"boring"`.

 # Example Input:
Input: 
Activity table:

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

Output: 

| fraction  |
|-----------|
| 0.33      |

Explanation: 
 - Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33


## üí° SQL Solution

```sql


WITH
  Players AS (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY 1
  )
SELECT ROUND(
    COUNT(Players.player_id) / (
      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Activity.player_id)
      FROM Activity
    ),
    2
  ) AS fraction
FROM Players
INNER JOIN Activity
  ON (
    Players.player_id = Activity.player_id
    AND DATEDIFF(Players.first_login, Activity.event_date) = -1)

SELECT * FROM Cinema 
WHERE id % 2 = 1
AND description !='boring' 
 ORDER BY rating DESC;
